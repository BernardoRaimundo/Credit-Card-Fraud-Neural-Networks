# Credit-Card-Fraud-Neural-Networks

Credit card fraud can be defined as a case where someone uses someone elseÂ´s credit card for personal reasons while the owner and the card issuing authorities are unaware of the fact that the card is being used. In an era of digitalization, the need to identify credit card frauds is necessary. Fraud detection involves monitoring and analysing the behaviour of various users to perceive, detect or avoid undesirable actions. To perform credit card fraud detection effectively, there is a need to understand what is behind it.

This problem is particularly challenging from the perspective of learning, credit card fraud is usually associated with class imbalance. Imbalanced data typically refers to a problem with classification problems where the classes are not represented equally. In credit card fraud it is very common that the number of legitimate transactions far outnumber the ones that are considered fraudulent.

Machine learning models are employed to analyse all the authorized transactions and report any suspicious activities. These reports are then investigated by professional who contact cardholders to confirm if the transaction performed was genuine or not. So, in hindsight, there is a need to train and update these models regularly to improve fraud-detection performance overtime.

Recently, developments in deep learning methodologies have been applied to solve complex problems in various areas. 

Experimental results show great performance of the proposed deep learning methods against traditional machine learning models imply that the proposed approaches can be implemented effectively for real-world credit card fraud detection systems.
This report presents a study of a possible deep learning approach for the credit card fraud detection problem by presenting three distinct approaches to our neural network
